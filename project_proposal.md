## Proposal

### Objective
Predict annual age-adjusted rate of deaths from drug overdose per state (vs county) based on demographic, economic, legislative, and medical data.

### Proposed data sources
1. Main source: NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by County
	* This data source does not actually have the number of deaths, it has an estimated age-adjusted death rate in 16 categories; if I were to use this data set, the target variable would be ordinal data, not continuous. However, since these 16 categories are equally spaced and numeric, it would be easy and probably appropriate to treat these categories as numbers (e.g. 1-16). [Link](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Drug-Poisoning-Mortality-by-County-United-Sta/p56q-jrxg)
	* The data source that would probably be more exact in terms of getting raw numbers would be the [CDC WONDER database, detailed mortality](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html). There are a couple ways to get data out of this database. There is a CDC WONDER API which is documented [here](https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/WONDER-API.html), but unfortunately, 'in keeping with the vital statistics policy for public data sharing, only national data are available for query by the API.' This means that I can't get data by any sub-national level, e.g. state or county, by using the API. Through their website interface, you **can** actually submit queries to get more local data, but this would essentially mean using Selenium to automate these queries.
2. Features/Regressors
	* Medical
		* Presence/absence of PDMP (prescription drug monitoring programs): [State Profiles with links for each state](http://www.pdmpassist.org/content/state-profiles), including what year each PDMP was created. This is not an entirely accurate list, e.g. this site states that California's PDMP was started in 1939. This is the year that California's triplicate prescription monitoring program was put in place, but a searchable electronic PDMP wasn't implemented until 2009 in California. So I may have to go and correct this list after scraping the initial list (e.g. find the year that the earliest electronic PDMP was set up, and get a list of those states, and then I may have to manually go out and find out the year that the electronic PDMP was started).
			* [Another link for California's PDMP](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/mtgs/pharm_awareness/conf_2013/august_2013/san_diego/small.pdf)
			* [History of PDMPs](http://www.pdmpassist.org/pdf/PPTs/LE2012/1_Giglio_HistoryofPDMPs.pdf)
			* Even within the PDMP, you could get other features, e.g. a variable of how old the PDMP is, whether or not it is mandatory and what year enrollment was mandatory, the volume of PDMP queries per year per state, etc. A lot of this data is available from the pdmpassist website.
		* Prescribing maps: [CDC opioid prescribing maps](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/maps/rxrate-maps.html). There are county maps from 2006 to 2016, but looking at the tables it looks like there are a lot of data points missing, so I guess I'll also have to figure out what would be a sensible number to substitute. Easiest way would be to fill the missing fields in with 0, but it might make more sense to instead get an average of the number of prescriptions in the neighboring counties. Here's a link to a county adjacency text [file](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/county-adjacency.html).
		* Number of methadone clinics per county. Here's a [directory](http://www.opiateaddictionresource.com/treatment/methadone_clinic_directory) of all of the methadone clinics located in the United States. Here's another [website](https://dpt2.samhsa.gov/treatment/directory.aspx) with a directory of opioid treatment programs in the entire country.
	* Legislative
		* Here's a [website](http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/ncsl-50-state-searchable-bill-tracking-databases.aspx) that contains links to 50-state searchable bill tracking databases. There are several different databases; the one that looks like it's going to be the most useful is the statewide prescription drug database, and to search each year, and create a vector for each year that is 50 rows long .
		* How times is the word 'opioid' or 'overdose' mentioned in press releases from the state's governor? Or, what you could do is go to [this website](https://www.congress.gov/state-legislature-websites) and go to each state legislature's website, and search their bills for the number of bills that match the criteria 'opioid' as a keyword. The tough part of this is that each state legislature website is going to have a different structure; is Selenium smart enough to click on whatever link can get you to 'bill search'?
	* Demographic/Economic
		* Probably most of this data can be used by querying US Census data. This is a [page](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/guidance/api-user-guide/query-examples.html) that gives examples on how to send queries to their API.
		* There's already a website called [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org/) that already has a github repository on methods to use to get census data.
